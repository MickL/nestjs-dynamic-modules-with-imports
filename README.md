# NestJS Sandbox: Configurable dynamic modules that import other configurable dynamic modules

This is a sandbox for figuring out how to pass (async) config to a dynamic module and importing/configuring another dynamic module with it.

Feel free to make PR's or discuss in the issues or at Stackoverflow. I would be very happy about each and every help!
